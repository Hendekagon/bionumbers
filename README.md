# bionumbers

Some code for converting the Bionumbers database, which comes for some reason in the form of an HTML table, into EDN

```
(require '[bionumbers.parse :as bp])

(take 3 (bp/html-clj (slurp "data/BioNumbers.xls")))

```

will attempt to parse values and ranges, but there's so
many inconsistent patterns remaining to cover
