For the transcription time observed of 75 seconds the chain growth rate of rRNA is thus calculated to be in the range of 60-80 nts/sec. Approximately 80 nt/sec according to Benno Muller-hill, 1996, The Lac Operon: A Short History Of A Genetic Paradigm, Publisher: Walter de Gruyter. Berlin. New York. Part 3.2 p.134.

Addition of rifampicin,which is known to inhibit initiation of transcription specifically (see e.g. Pato &amp; von Meyenburg 1970), together with a labeled precursor should make it possible to measure the time needed to transcribe the part of the operon preceding the 5S RNA gene by following the kinetics of accumulation of label in 5S RNA.

Mukai and Cockerham (1977) enriched the mutation frequency by accumulating isozyme mutations in 1000 chromosomes sheltered by heterozygosity in a balanced-lethal system for almost 175 generations. In 1,658,308 locus-generations they found three electrophoretic-mobility (band-shift) mutations and 17 null (band-loss) mutations. However, these strains exhibited a high rate of chromosome breakage, probably because of an active transposon (Yamaguchi and Mukai 1974) it is therefore probably more realistic to ignore the nulls, a procedure also justified by the high average ratio of base pair substitutions to other mutations in microbes (Drake 1991). Mukai and Cockerham (1977) estimated that about 0.3 of all amino acid changes were detectable as band shifts. In addition, only about 2/3 of base pair substitutions change an amino acid. Thus, the mutation rate per locus per generation is (3/1,658,308)/(0.3)(2/3) = 9.0 × 10^-6. Averaging the two studies, [investigators] take 8.5 × 10^-6 as a representative rate.

The fact that effective mutation rates in different species of bacteria and lower eukaryotes are similar (Table 4), despite wide variations in genome size and mode of reproduction, suggest either that differences in breeding system do not in fact matter very much, or that there is enough recombination in ostensibly asexual organisms such as bacteria (Maynard Smith 1991) that the differences in breeding system are more apparent than real. If the latter is the case, then the much higher effective mutation rates in higher eukaryotes (Table 5) can only be explained in the present model by a greatly increased cost of fidelity of replication per generation. Unfortunately, quantitative data on this cost are completely lacking, so that this conclusion remains speculative.&quot; Table 5 also gives: 1)Mutation rate per effective genome per replication, calculated thus: Taking 8×10^7 bases as effective genome (portion of genome in which mutations are deleterious): 8×10^7×5×10^-11=0.004mutations per effective genome per replication. 2)Mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation calculated by assuming that overwhelming majority of mutations take place in males and that number of divisions prior to sperm formation in male of age 30 is 400: 0.004mutation/base pair/replication×400replications/generation=1.6 mutations/effective genome/sexual generation.

In spite of this clever design, DNA molecules are subject to chemical alterations and physical damage. Some of this damage appears to occur through the actions of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions that are present at low concentration (~10^-7 M)at neutral pH. Often cited in this context is the process of depurination, in which the chemical bond linking a purine base (adenine or guanine) to deoxyribose breaks spontaneously (Figure 12.11A). By some estimates, as many as 10,000 purine bases are lost by depurination each day in a mammalian cell. (This amounts to more than 10^17 chemically altered nucleotides generated each day in the human body!) Depyrimidination occurs at a 20- to 100-fold lower rate, but still results in as many as 500 cytosine and thymine bases lost per cell per day.

In spite of this clever design, DNA molecules are subject to chemical alterations and physical damage. Some of this damage appears to occur through the actions of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions that are present at low concentration (~10^-7 M)at neutral pH. Often cited in this context is the process of depurination, in which the chemical bond linking a purine base (adenine or guanine) to deoxyribose breaks spontaneously (Figure 12.11A). By some estimates, as many as 10,000 purine bases are lost by depurination each day in a mammalian cell. (This amounts to more than 10^17 chemically altered nucleotides generated each day in the human body!) Depyrimidination occurs at a 20- to 100-fold lower rate, but still results in as many as 500 cytosine and thymine bases lost per cell per day.

A dye will emit light of a certain wavelength after being exposed to light of another wavelength. However, having being illuminated beyond a certain intensity it will lose its ability to emit light, a phenomenon known as photobleaching. In FRAP a limited area (often of a cell membrane) of known fluorescence is photobleached. Fluorescent molecules outside of this area will diffuse into it, resulting in fluorescence recovery. By constant tracking of fluorescence level, fluorescence recovery is measurable by two parameters: 1)The time for recovery to have occurred (the shorter the time, the faster the diffusion of neighboring molecules). 2)The percent of original fluorescence before (photobleaching) restored after recovery has reached saturation.

Alignments of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to the genome suggest that the draft assembly is 95% complete (primary source).&quot;", :units "%", :range "Table link - http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/files/Properties%20of%20several%20sequenced%20genomes.pdf"} {:properties "GC content", :organism "Thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 36, :comments "44% in coding sequences", :primary-source "", :bion-id "100680", :reference-pubmed-id "17932292", :keywords "&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "Merchant et al., The Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions, Science, Vol 318, Issue 5848, 2007 p.247 table 1", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "%", :range ""} {:properties "Number of genes", :organism "Green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 15143, :comments "For average gene length of 4,312bp see p.247 table 1 http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/files/Properties%20of%20several%20sequenced%20genomes.pdf", :primary-source "", :bion-id "100681", :reference-pubmed-id "17932292", :keywords "genome, proteome, genetic material, expression&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "Merchant et al., The Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions, Science. 2007 Oct 12 318(5848):245-50. p.247 table 1", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "genes", :range "Table link - http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/files/Properties%20of%20several%20sequenced%20genomes.pdf"} {:properties "Number of tRNA types", :organism "Green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 259, :comments "", :primary-source "", :bion-id "100682", :reference-pubmed-id "17932292", :keywords "transfer ribonucleic acid&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "Merchant et al., The Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions, Science, Vol 318, Issue 5848, 2007 p.247 table 1", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "unitless", :range "Table link - http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/files/Properties%20of%20several%20sequenced%20genomes.pdf"} {:properties "Number of tRNA types", :organism "Human Homo sapiens", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 497, :comments "", :primary-source "", :bion-id "100683", :reference-pubmed-id "17932292", :keywords "transfer ribonucleic acid&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "Merchant et al., The Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions, Science, Vol 318, Issue 5848, 2007 p.247 table 1", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "unitless", :range ""} {:properties "Number of tRNA types", :organism "Thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 589, :comments "", :primary-source "", :bion-id "100684", :reference-pubmed-id "17932292", :keywords "transfer ribonucleic acid&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "Merchant et al., The Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions, Science, Vol 318, Issue 5848, 2007 p.247 table 1", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "unitless", :range "Table link - http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/files/Properties%20of%20several%20sequenced%20genomes.pdf"} {:properties "Doubling time of cancerous cell lines", :organism "Human Homo sapiens", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value "", :comments "Information on generation time, in hours, of the NCI set of 60 cancerous cell lines.

The record grooves, which have a width of about 80 µm and a depth of about 40 µm, are dark in the picture.

A drop of the particle suspension is spread out on a flat disk or plate equipped with V-shaped grooves such as are present on a gramophone disk. After drying, the particles are located on the bottom of the grooves and are thus aligned in a one-dimensional array. The new alignment procedure is demonstrated with a suspension of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres (diameter 3.8 µm) and a suspension of the unicellular algae chlorella vulgaris (diameter about 3µm). It appears that the alignment of cells and spheres is very good. When using microspheres, more than 95% of the particles in the grooves are located within ±2 µm of the centre line of the groove. Based upon this cell-alignment principle, a new cytometer, named the cytodisk, is proposed. The proposed system has a number of advantages over the flow cytometer, among which is the unique ability of relocating a previously measured cell for further measurement or visual examination. A prototype of a cytodisk, developed for initial test measurements, was built in the researchers' laboratory. The apparatus, constructed from a record player and ordinary long-playing records, uses a simple mechanical tracking system and a single optical fiber for fluorescence excitation and detection.&quot; See fig. 7-9 in article", :units "µm", :range "~2-4"} {:properties "Pseudogenes", :organism "Human Homo sapiens", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 2081, :comments "Assembly:  NCBI 36, Oct 2005 Genebuild:  Ensembl, Dec 2006 Database version:  49.36k", :primary-source "", :bion-id "101482", :reference-pubmed-id "", :keywords "&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/index.html", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "genes", :range ""} {:properties "RNA genes", :organism "Human Homo sapiens", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 4421, :comments "Assembly:  NCBI 36, Oct 2005 Genebuild:  Ensembl, Dec 2006 Database version:  49.36k", :primary-source "", :bion-id "101483", :reference-pubmed-id "", :keywords "&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;/WF_SQL_XSRF.html&quot;&gt;", :reference "http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/index.html", :entered-by "Ron Milo - Admin", :measurement-method "", :units "genes", :range ""} {:properties "Overall genome size", :organism "Human Homo sapiens", :primary-source-pubmed-id "", :value 3080000000, :comments "P.932 right column: &quot;The euchromatic genome is thus ~2.88 Gb and the overall human genome is ~3.08 Gb.&quot; See http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/StatsTable for the &quot;Golden path length&quot; For Euchromatic genome see BNID 100396 Comment from JH: &quot;Because the human genome size is about 3 billion, and cells contain a genome from mom and another from dad, human cells (except germ cells) contain about 6 billion base pairs.&quot;", :primary-source "", :bion-id "101484", :reference-pubmed-id "15496913", :keywords "genetic material, DNA, nucleic acid, heredity, chromatin", :reference "International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium.

Soon after the MBT [mid-blastula transition], the intracellular amounts of putrescine and spermidine ceased to increase and remained at a constant level at least up to gastrulation. The amount of ornithine/embryo increased very slightly over the period studied. To quantitatively correlate the changes in ODC activity and intracellular polyamines, [investigators] determined that the K[m]Orn of Xenopus ODC is 100±10µM and that the ratio of ODC activity measured at 37C (temperature of the in vitro assay)/ that at 20C (incubation temperature of the embryos) was 3.9±0.2 (data not shown). Using these two values and knowing the amount of intracellular ornithine (Fig. 3) and hence the concentration of ornithine (embryo volume 1µl), [they] calculated that during the first 8 h of development the integrated in vivo activity would have converted 0.8±0.1nmol ornithine into putrescine.

The first to apply this technique to microbial biomass were Battley et al. [primary source 38]. They measured the heat capacity of lyophilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells over a temperature range of 10300 K, and consequently determined the entropy of the dried biomass. Assuming that the entropy of hydration and the residual entropy of biomass are small enough to be neglected, the Gibbs energy of combustion is calculated to be 515.0 kJ/C-mol. More recently, Battley [primary source 39] proposed an empirical method to estimate the entropy of the biomass based on the atomic entropies of the atoms comprising the biomass. As he showed, this method gives very good accuracy as compared to the values calculated based on the experimentally determined entropies.

The first measurements of RNA polymerase II transcription rates in mammalian cells were performed in the 1970s, when the average rate of increase in length of total, metabolically labeled pre-mRNA was found to be 50100 nucleotides per second (Sehgal et al., 1976). Since then, other studies have measured transcription speeds, by several techniques and in different conditions, at 1872 nucleotides per second (primary sources). It is unclear exactly why this broad range of velocities has been observed.
